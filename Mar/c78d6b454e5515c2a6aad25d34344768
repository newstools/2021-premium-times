The Federal High Court in Kano has convicted Maryam Abu Shinga for retaining proceeds of crime. A statement by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Wednesday stated that the judge, Lewis Allagoa, passed his judgment on the convict on Tuesday. The statement added that the convict entered a plea bargain agreement with the prosecution that saw the judge sentence her to pay N110, 000,000 in restitution to victims. No jail term was imposed on her, according to the statement. The convict lured her victims into a phony gold mining investment that she promised would yield 300 per cent profit for investors. She claimed that an investor who put in N500,000 could earn N1.5 million as returns on investment within four weeks.
