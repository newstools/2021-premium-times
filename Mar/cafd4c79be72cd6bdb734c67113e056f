CBS has released a new clip of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s anticipated sit-down with Oprah Winfrey. In the clip, as published and reported by the New York Post, Markle says of Buckingham Palace, “I don’t know how they could expect that after all of this time, we would still just be silent.” “How do you feel about the Palace hearing your speak your truth today?” Winfrey asks as violins dramatically begin to swell in the background. “I don’t know how they could expect that after all of this time, we would still just be silent, if there is an active role that the Firm is playing in perpetuating falsehoods about us,” Markle says, using a nickname for the royals purportedly originated by King George VI. “And if that comes with risk of losing things,” she adds, “there’s a lot that’s been lost already.” The newspaper also reported that much of the conversation around the interview this week “has been monopolised by accusations made against Markle, 39, that she bullied at least two palace aides during her short time within the said Firm”. The Times of London quoted sources as saying that the Duchess of Sussex “actually reduced staffers to tears during her Kensington Palace tenure.” The New York Post also reported that Markle called the claims a “calculated smear campaign” timed to the Winfrey tell-all, as Buckingham Palace announced a probe into the allegations Wednesday. Markle and Harry exited the Royal Family and moved Stateside in a breathlessly covered January 2020 decision dubbed “Megxit.” Source: New York Post Donate TEXT AD: To advertise here .
