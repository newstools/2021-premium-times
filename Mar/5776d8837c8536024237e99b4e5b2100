While there was back-slapping across the country on Friday on the presumed double victory for Nigeria’s Amaju Pinnick at the 43rd Ordinary and Elective Assembly in Rabat, Morocco, the NFF moved on Saturday to make some clarification. In a statement issued by the NFF’s Director of Communications, Ademola Olajire, reports suggesting the appointment of Pinnick as CAF’s Fifth Vice President were incorrect. The NFF General Secretary, Mohammed Sanusi said such was never even discussed either on the floor of the Congress or at any meeting of the CAF leadership. “The President of NFF, Mr Amaju Melvin Pinnick was elected as Member of the FIFA Council at the Congress, and that is what we are celebrating. Nobody approached him or put it up for discussion at any forum that he would be 5th Vice President. “Mr Pinnick served as the 1st Vice President of CAF for a year, between 2018 and 2019, before the former leadership of CAF opted not to renew his tenure. There is no way he will now agree to be a 5th Vice President. He is contented being a Member of the esteemed FIFA Council – the highest decision-making body in world football – and a high –ranking member of CAF Executive Committee.” In Friday’s election, Mr Pinnick thumped incumbent Walter Nyamilandu of Malawi by 43 votes to 8 to become only the third Nigerian to take a seat in world football’s highest decision-making organ, after late Etubom Oyo Orok Oyo and Amos Adamu.
