Flutterwave, an Africa-focused payments company, on Wednesday announced that it has secured $170 million from a leading group of international investors to expand its customer base in existing and international markets and to develop new products. With this, Flutterwave could consider a New York listing, a Reuters report quoted its chief executive officer and co-founder, Olugbenga Agboola, to have said. “We may consider the possibility of listing in New York or a possible dual listing in New York and Nigeria,” Mr Agboola said. According to a statement from the firm, the company’s valuation is now in excess of $1 billion. The fundraise brings the total investment in Flutterwave to $225 million, it said in a statement, and that the COVID-19 pandemic had accelerated the shift to digital payments in Africa.
