Nigeria has received 3.94 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine through the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Assess Facility, COVAX. This makes Nigeria the third Africa country to benefit from the COVAX facility after Ghana and Ivory Coast. COVAX, an initiative co-led by the vaccine alliance, GAVI and the World Health Organisation (WHO) aims to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines by dividing about two billion doses across 92 low and middle-income countries. The facility promises access to vaccines for up to 20 per cent of participating countriesâ€™ population with an initial supply beginning in the first quarter of the year to immunise three per cent of their populations. The COVID-19 vaccines arrived at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International airport at about 11:45 a.m. on Tuesday. Donate TEXT AD: To advertise here .
