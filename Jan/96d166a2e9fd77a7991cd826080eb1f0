Managers Frank Lampard and Pep Guardiola will be targeting a fine start to the year when they clash at Stamford Bridge Sunday evening in the Premier League’s first blockbuster fixture for 2021. Chelsea’s last match of 2020 saw the Blues held to a 1-1 draw by Aston Villa, while a coronavirus-hit Manchester City last took to the pitch on Boxing Day in their comfortable victory over Newcastle United. Both Chelsea and City are outside the top four at the moment hence they would covet getting all the points they can to secure a Champions League spot and then possibly challenge for the title proper. Sunday’s game at Stamford Bridge represents the 166th meeting between Chelsea and Manchester City in all competitions, with the Blues coming out on top 68 times compared to City’s 58. Despite losing at Stamford Bridge last season, City have triumphed in six out of the last eight games between the two clubs in all competitions hence they would fancy their chances against the shaky Blues this evening.
