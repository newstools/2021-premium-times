The Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) has criticised Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State for rejecting COVID-19 vaccines. Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State and Chairman of NGF, said this in a statement on Thursday in Abuja after the forum’s first virtual meeting for 2021. Mr Fayemi said the governors met and ”deliberated on matters of national importance, particularly the procurement and administration of COVID-19 vaccines in the country”. PREMIUM TIMES had reported how Mr Bello, who had lied in the past about the status of the deadly COVID-19 in Nigeria, condemned the COVID-19 vaccination, saying ”it was meant to kill people”. “On the ill-fated pronouncement made by a member of the forum regarding the COVID-19 vaccine in a national daily, the forum totally and categorically dissociated itself from the statement. “The forum emphasised that it will continue to be informed and guided by science and will ensure that every decision it takes will help retain public and professional trust and is not compromised by conflicts of interest,” he said. Mr Fayemi also briefed the governors on his meeting with the Chairperson of Board of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI), Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, on the rollout of the COVAX facility. “COVAX is a global risk-sharing mechanism co-led by GAVI, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to facilitate pooled procurement and the equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines across developing countries,” he said.
