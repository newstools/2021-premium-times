Suspected bandits on Saturday night killed about 14 villagers in Kaya, a village in Giwa Local Government Area of Kaduna State, when they attacked the community. The incident happened around 6:30 p.m. when the bandits, said to be on a revenge mission, stormed the small village killing the victims and setting vehicles ablaze. A resident of the community, who simply identified himself as Suleiman, said nine people sustained injuries. According to him, earlier on Friday, some vigilantes in the community killed some of the bandits who attacked a neighbouring village. ”The bandits attacked our village in revenge of the killings of their members by our vigilante after abducting and killing one person on 1 and 2 January. So they returned in the night on Saturday in large number on motorcycles and killed 14 people,” he said. Confirming the killings, the Kaduna Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, in a statement, described the killings as counter killings. He said the military and other security agencies have informed Kaduna State Government that several lives were lost in the attack <img data-attachment-id="434697" data-permalink="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/434693-bandits-attack-kaduna-community-kill-14.html/attachment/vehicle-set-ablaze-by-the-bandits-in-kaya-village-during-the-attack" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2021/01/vehicle-set-ablaze-by-the-bandits-in-Kaya-village-during-the-attack-e1609699374833.jpg?fit=768%2C832&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="768,832" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Vehicle set ablaze by the bandits in Kaya village during the attack" data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;Vehicle set ablaze by the bandits in Kaya village during the attack&lt;/p&gt;
