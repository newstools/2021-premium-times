In February, 2020, at Angwan Alkali, Mararaban Rido area, a suburb of Kaduna metropolis, gunmen reportedly invaded the home of an unnamed prison warder at about 1 a.m. and killed him. A neighbour, who was said to have raised the alarm on sighting the armed men who were trying to break into the warder’s compound, was also reportedly murdered alongside his 13-year-old daughter kidnapped. Kaduna has been one of Nigeria’s hotbeds of kidnapping in the recent time with cases of abduction, banditry, killing and violent communal clashes frequently reported. On Monday, December 28, 2020, the Kaduna State Government reported the death of a notorious bandit, Nasiru Katchalla, who was said to have been killed by rivals in a fight for supremacy over territory. The late Katchalla was said to have been responsible for a string of kidnappings, killings and banditry in the state, and particularly, along Kaduna-Abuja road. The state’s commissioner for internal security and homeland affairs, Samuel Aruwan, made the disclosure in a statement on Monday. Donate TEXT AD: To advertise here .
