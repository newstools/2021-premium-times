Chelsea have officially named Thomas Tuchel as their new manager. The 47-year-old German manager had previously managed German clubs Mainz and Borussia Dortmund. His last role was as the head coach of French giant PSG from where he was sacked last December. Tuchel replaces Frank Lampard who was relieved of his position on Monday. The German signed an 18 months contract with the option of an extra year extension. While speaking with his new club’s official website, Tuchel expressed great delight at the chance given to him to lead the Blues; adding that he is eager to hit the ground running immediately. He said: “‘I would like to thank Chelsea FC for their confidence in me and my staff. ‘We all have the greatest respect for Frank Lampard’s work and the legacy he created at Chelsea. At the same time, I cannot wait to meet my new team and compete in the most exciting league in football. I am grateful to now be part of the Chelsea family – it feels amazing!’ Director Marina Granovskaia added: ‘It is never easy to change Head Coach in the middle of the season but we are very happy to secure one of Europe’s best coaches in Thomas Tuchel. There is still much to play for and much to achieve, this season and beyond. We welcome Thomas to the Club.” Thomas Tuchel is  and 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 to work at Cobham! #WelcomeTuchel pic.twitter.com/kJDDzDPfYq — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) January 26, 2021  Tuchel will take his first training session this evening and will be in the dugout for Chelsea’s Premier League game against Wolves.
