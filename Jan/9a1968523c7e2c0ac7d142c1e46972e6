The Governor of Borno State, Babagana Zulum, on Monday, laid the foundation for Al-Ansar University, the first privately-owned university in the state. Mr Zulum, whose administration allocated 100 hectares of land to Al-Ansar Foundation for the university, also directed the construction of 2.3 kilometre road and a borehole in the university in his address at the event. The governor also directed the Ministry of Higher Education to liaise with the founder of the university to see how the government could further support the project. Mr Zulum, who reiterated the commitment of his administration to education in the state, promised similar support for anyone interested in providing quality education in Borno. “We are very much willing to support any individual or group willing to partner the state government in order to provide the much needed qualitative education to our children at all levels,” Mr Zulum said. In his remarks, the founder of the university and President of Al-Ansar Foundation, Muhammad Dikwa, said that the university would be taking off with two colleges. Mr Dikwa lauded the administration of Mr Zulum for its commitment to education in the state and assured it of sustained investment in education in the state. (NAN) Donate TEXT AD: To advertise here .
