After about 40 years in service, Nigeria’s service chiefs officially resigned from service. Presidential spokesperson, Femi Adesina, said on Tuesday that President Muhammadu Buhari accepted the immediate resignation and retirement from service of the Chief of Defence Staff, Gabriel Olonisakin, a general. Mr Olonisakin resigned and retired from service alongside Tukur Buratai, Chief of Army Staff; Abubakar Sadique, Chief of Air Staff, and Ibok Ibas, Chief of Naval Staff. Their stay, which is said to be the longest in the history of the armed forces, was characterised by controversies over their retirement. Generally, the minimum age for enlisting into the Nigerian Armed Forces is put at 18 years old for voluntary service. A military personnel is also expected to retire at 60 years or after putting in 35 years of service, according to the Federal Civil Service Rule. But the Olonisakin-led service Chiefs spent between 36-40 years in service, far above their retirement age. They were appointed on July 13, 2015, after President Muhammadu Buhari assumed office. President Buhari first extended their services by two years in 2015, and later renewed it in 2017 without an end. But more than five years on, they were unable to implement any coherent strategy to defeat Boko Haram, which turned out to be one of the main reasons Nigerians called for their sack. Although the terrorists were largely limited to three North-eastern states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe, they were still able to carry out attacks at will in those states. PREMIUM TIMES reported on many occasions how the Boko Haram sect and its breakaway faction, groups like the Islamic State’s West Africa Province (ISWAP) terrorised the northern parts of the country for more than 10 years. Apart from the Boko Haram insurgency, in the last four years, there has been a surge in kidnapping and banditry across the country. OLONISAKIN
