The federal government on Tuesday emphasised the ban on rice importation into Nigeria. The Comptroller, Nigerian Customs Service in charge of Sokoto and Zamfara, Abdulhamid Ma’aji, made the emphasis at the reopening of Illela Border in Sokoto State. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the government made the emphasis as importers and exporters in Sokoto get excited at the reopening of the Illela border. The Illela border was reopened by dignitaries from Nigeria and Niger Republic. Mr Ma’aji said that the border reopening was being monitored to ensure sanity.
He said border closure was in the interest of Nigerians. The comptroller noted that many instruments used by criminals were brought into the country through land borders.
