Sunshine Stars have an axe to grind with Rangers as they have had no victory to savour over the Flying Antelopes in their last five meetings. With a point between them, Rangers have the better current form-unbeaten in five, but Lobi Stars held them to a scoreless draw in their last match. For Sunshine Stars, they need to follow up their away win over Dakkada to move above Rangers and to within a point of current league leaders, Rivers United. Leading the line for Gbenga Ogunbote’s team will be Sadeeq Yusuf, who already has four goals this season, while Salisu Yusuf will rely on a mean defence that has conceded only three goals.

United were brought down to earth on Wednesday when they lost at home to the basement side, Sheffield United while Arsenal continued their good recent form by snagging a come-from-behind victory away to Southampton. For the Gunners, their captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, will continue to be absent while Kieran Tierney could return. There are doubts over the fitness of Emile Smith Rowe and Thomas Partey, though Mikel Arteta could give Martin Odegaard some minutes. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer needs an immediate response to keep United in the title picture but will have to decide on who will start as his No.9 between Edinson Cavani and Anthony Martial.

Utd The last five matches between these two sides have produced 23 goals, an average of over four goals per match with their last meeting coming just last Wednesday in the Coppa Italia. That ended 3-2 in Atalanta’s favour. Papu Gomez has been sold and Gianpiero Gasperini is also hampered by the absences of Robin Gosens, who is suspended while Hans Hateboer is injured and Mario Pasalic continues his injury rehabilitation. Lazio are on a good run in Serie A, having won their last four matches that included a 3-0 rout of Roma. Ciro Immobile, with 13 goals, will lead this Lazio team while Atalanta’s highest goal scorer, Luis Muriel, will probably start the match on the substitutes’ bench. It promises to be another goalfest from two sides, who attack more than they defend.

This is then a revenge match for Messi as he leads his team against Asier Villalibre and the Marcelino-led team, who are enjoying a purple patch. Messi, already with 11 league goals, will seek to play in-between the lines to disrupt the well-organised defensive structure that Marcelino has instituted since he took over. Midfield anchor Sergio Busquets is suspended but Miralem Pjanic is ready while right back Sergino Dest is ready to make a return. Athletic may play with two central attackers in Raul Garcia and Inaki Williams up top after they smashed Getafe 5-1 in midweek.
