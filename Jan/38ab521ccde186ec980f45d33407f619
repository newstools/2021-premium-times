The passing of Pst Yinka Akinbami has become most painful because if there truly were good men, he was certainly one. To my brother, sleep well till we meet to part no more. “Indeed yesterday was one of the saddest and blackest days of my life….was for a bit conflicted about admitting the reality or wishing it was just a nightmare…but we remain comforted that He is in a better place,” he wrote. Mr Adeyinka passed on after contracting the COVID-19 virus. It is unclear whether he had underlying health conditions that contributed to his death. PREMIUM TIMES has reported how Nigeria is experiencing a second wave of the virus with more cases recorded in the past month than at any other time.
