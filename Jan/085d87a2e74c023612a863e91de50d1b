According to him, the ages of the offenders range from 14 to 58 years. “Out of these numbers, 257 associated with the offences directly or were accomplices to the crime were charged to court. “A total of 214 people, who are drug users, were counselled and released,’’ Mr Igwenagu said.

Mr Igwenagu told NAN that the command also embarked on advocacy visits to various stakeholders such as traditional institutions, relevant Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), media houses and Religious organisations. He said the purpose of the visit was to sensitise the stakeholders and the public on the dangers of drug abuse and trafficking. He pointed out that the command had noticed the alarming rate women are getting involved in drug activities in the state. “This portends a great danger to the healthy upbringing of our youths.   He expressed appreciation to the people and government of Lagos State as well as sister security agencies for continuous support to the command. “The command, however, still seeks continuous assistance from all Lagosians by providing credible information on illicit drug activities in their neighbourhoods. “Together we will reduce the menace of illicit drug abuse and trafficking in Lagos to the barest minimum,’’ he said. Despite being an illegal substance , the sales and consumption of Indian hemp in Nigeria are a thriving business. (NAN) Donate TEXT AD: To advertise here .
