Over 30,000 candidates that sat for the Senior School Certificate Examination (SSCE) in 2020, were involved in one examination malpractice or the other, the National Examination Council (NECO) said. The council announced the release of the results at its headquarters in Minna, Niger State, on Wednesday. The Registrar of the council, Godswill Obioma, said it was a defining moment for the council, given the challenging circumstances in which the examinations were conducted last year. He also spoke about the challenges faced by the council during the conduct of the exam, ranging from the COVID-19 pandemic to the EndSARS protest staged nationwide. “Gentlemen of the Press, my dear colleagues, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, I am happy to inform you that despite the challenges of 2020, which affected the conduct of the 2020 SSCE (Internal) and our set targets, the Council has successfully concluded all the processes leading to the release of the results of the 2020 SSCE (Internal). The results are being released timeously after the last paper was written on the 28th November, 2020. This, no doubt is a big achievement,” he said.
