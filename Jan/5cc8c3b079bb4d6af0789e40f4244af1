In the first match of 2021 in the Bundesliga, Borussia Monchengladbach came from a two-goal deficit to defeat Bayern Munich 3-2 on Friday at Borussia Park on Friday. Bayern took a two-goal lead through Robert Lewandowski and Leon Goretzka in the 20th and 26th minutes. This should have ensured a smooth sail to a win, but they make Monchengladbach of sterner stuff these days and they hit back with two goals in the 35th and 45th minutes through Jonas Hofmann. Florian Neuhaus scored the third five minutes into the second half.     Five minutes after the restart, Neuhaus got his chance after slack marking in the Bayern box to complete the turnaround. After this, Bayern pushed forward and Hansi Flick sent on Kingsley Coman for Douglas Costa, but Monchengladbach held firm with Nico Elvedi and Ginter were heroic in their defending. Ginter cleared off the line in the first minute of added time.   Donate TEXT AD: To advertise here .
