The Nigeria Professional Football League matchday three games will be taking place across the country this weekend with a derby clash in Lagos. The only two teams from the South-West region of Nigeria in the NPFL, MFM FC and Sunshine Stars of Akure, will be battling it out Sunday at the Agege Stadium, Lagos. Both teams are evenly matched going into this tie; having recorded a win and a loss each in their two matches played so far in the new season. Going by the records, Lagos has never been a good hunting ground for Sunshine Stars as they have lost in all their previous visits to the Center of Excellence. However, the Akure-based team can be buoyed by the return of coach Gbenga Ogunbote to their fold as he is one of the managers that has been able to unlock the secret of the Olukoya Boys. In his last visit to Lagos, while he was in charge of Enugu Rangers, Ogunbote was able to get a point and he would be hoping for the same in Sunday’s tie if not more. As for the Coach of MFM FC, Tony Bolus, getting back to winning ways after the setback in the game against Lobi Stars in Markudi is paramount. “Our target is to win as many matches as we can whether we are home or away, so against Sunshine Stars we will be sticking to this target,” The MFM coach said in a radio interview.
