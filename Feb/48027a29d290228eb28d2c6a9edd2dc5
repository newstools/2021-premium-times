President Buhari made his feelings known in a statement by his spokesperson, Femi Adesina, in Abuja on Sunday. Mr Buhari extended heartfelt condolences to family members, friends and colleagues of those who died as a result of the tragedy. He joined the Nigerian Air Force, the military and other Nigerians in mourning the unfortunate loss of the dedicated and courageous personnel who died in the line of duty. The President noted that while investigations into the cause of the crash are ongoing, ”the safety of the Nigerian airspace remains a key priority of the government.” He prayed that God would comfort the bereaved families and the nation and grant the souls of the departed peaceful rest.
