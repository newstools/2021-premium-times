The secretary of Owerri branch of the NBA, Chinedu Agu, gave details of the preliminary observations from the scene of the incident in a statement on Sunday. He said there were deep machete cuts on the deceased person’s neck and wrist regions. According to him, Mr Nwankwo had left home for work and did not return on Saturday.

It stated that following a report, “operatives of the Command moved to the scene (his office) and met the lifeless body of the lawyer in the pool of his own blood, with machete cuts on his neck.” The statement added, “Taking a further look around the office, a matchet with blood stains, suspected to have been the matchet used in inflicting the cuts on him, was found on the floor. “It was also discovered that his car and other yet to be identified items were taken away.” NBA President, Olumide Akpata, who also confirmed the incident in a thread of tweets on Sunday, said he had contacted the incumbent and another past chair of the Owerri branch of the association to express his condolences. <img data-attachment-id="441229" data-permalink="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/441217-former-nba-chief-killed-in-suspected-machete-attack-in-imo.html/attachment/olumide-akpata-nba-president-1" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2021/02/olumide-akpata-nba-president-1.jpeg?fit=540%2C423&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="540,423" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="olumide-akpata-nba-president-1" data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;Olumide Akpata&lt;/p&gt;
