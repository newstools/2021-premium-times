The Nigerian government has published the passport details of another 100 travellers who failed to undergo the mandatory COVID-19 test after returning into the country. This is the second time passport details of travellers violating compulsory COVID-19 protocols will be published. The latest details were posted on the official Twitter page of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 on Tuesday morning. The affected passengers will be restricted from travelling out of the country for the next six months, according to the PTF. “Presidential Task Force (PTF) sanctions 100 Passports in Second Batch of those who failed to comply with the mandatory Day 7 post-arrival COVID-19 Test.” “PENALTY: 6-month travel restriction from Feb 5 to July 30, 2021.” The PTF had in January released details of 100 travellers who violated the protocols put in place to limit spread of the COVID-19 virus. The Chairman of the PTF, Boss Mustapha, at its briefing said the passports will be suspended to serve as a deterrent to others.
