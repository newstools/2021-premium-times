Profit-taking particularly in big-cap industrial stocks on Friday ended the feeble recovery posted by the Nigerian bourse on Thursday as the bourse went down by 1.40 per cent or N166.515 billion. This reversed the gain reported for Thursday trade and raising fears that a sustained rebound may still be far from a market that has recorded just one session of gain so far this month. Livestock Feeds, NEM, BUA Cement, Sovereign Insurance and Dangote Cement drove the downbeat performance as huge volumes of shares in those stocks were up for sale.
