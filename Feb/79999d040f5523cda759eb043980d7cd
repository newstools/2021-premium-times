Less than 24 hours to Sunday’s Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) tie in Kaduna between Jigawa Golden Stars and Adamawa United, findings by PREMIUM TIMES suggest that the Adamawa team is ‘stranded’ in Bauchi State. Multiple sources close to the team told PREMIUM TIMES the Yola-based club has been going through ‘hell’ in the past weeks and an embarrassing walkover on Sunday may finally reveal allegations of financial mismanagement and paucity of funds that hafe reportedly been rocking Adamawa United. Adamawa United are rock bottom on the NPFL table and are the only team yet to register any win after eight rounds of games in the new season. It now looks like the reasons for their misapplication in the league is not too far-fetched. The team is reportedly broke. “We are in Bauchi stranded, our getting to Bauchi was even with the help of a kind-hearted individual who shouldered our accommodation and feeding for two days while we await our officials (Adamawa United) to bring in funds, up till now, there is no sign we are going for the match,” an official of the team told PREMIUM TIMES on the condition of anonymity on Saturday. With a reported N12.8 million monthly allocation from the state government, players and officials of Adamawa United are at a loss why they have been subjected to inhumane treatment that has contributed in no small measure to their disappointing results in the league.

I travelled and will be back on Monday by God’s grace,” the commissioner replied to PREMIUM TIMES’ request for his reaction. Donate TEXT AD: To advertise here .
