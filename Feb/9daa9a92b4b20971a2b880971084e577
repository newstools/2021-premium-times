Nigerian equities mounted further loss on Monday as the bourse of Africa’s largest economy saw its longest losing streak so far this year with stocks shedding over N442.386 billion in the last six days of trade, going down by 0.34 per cent. No trading session has recorded gain this month and that sets grim prospects for an exchange that emerged the best-performing in January. Monday’s loss was driven by losses in bank and consumer goods stocks especially GTB, PZ, Flour Mills, Unilever and Champions Breweries. Meanwhile, analysts expect the embargo on crypto-currencies to bolster activity at the equity market. The News Agency of Nigeria reported that Ambrose Omordion, the chief operating officer of InvestData Limited said in an interview that the Central Bank of Nigeria’s action should aid the movement of funds into the stock market in a bid to find higher yields. He added that it would back market recovery as the earnings season for 2020 financial results shapes up. “The ban on cryptocurrency will trigger circular flow of funds searching for a better return as the equity market today is ahead of year-on-year headline inflation. “The market is expected to rebound in the new week on earnings season kicking off with early fliers that will come with dividend report. “We advise that you target dividend-paying stocks and fundamentally sound companies with growth prospect in 2021, especially given the low interest rates regime and sustained oil price rally that have so far supported the economy and equity market,” Mr Omordion said.
