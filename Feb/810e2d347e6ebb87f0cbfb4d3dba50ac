He noted that Kellogg’s being a children friendly brand was worried about the startling number of out-of-school children in the country where available statistics from UNICEF confirms one in every five children to be out of school in the world is from Nigeria. “Considering the huge gap, we decided to intervene with the initiative to support parents in our own little ways at ensuring that children have access to basic education and more importantly, to improve the writing skills and creative ingenuity of children,” he said. <img data-attachment-id="443626" data-permalink="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/promoted/443601-kelloggs-fulfils-n10-million-scholarship-promise-to-children.html/attachment/3-min" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2021/02/3-min.jpg?fit=1080%2C715&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1080,715" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="3-min" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2021/02/3-min.jpg?fit=526%2C349&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2021/02/3-min.jpg?fit=1080%2C715&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-443626" src="https://i1.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2021/02/3-min.jpg?ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2021/02/3-min.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://i1.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2021/02/3-min.jpg?resize=526%2C349&amp;ssl=1 526w, https://i1.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2021/02/3-min.jpg?resize=768%2C508&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2021/02/3-min.jpg?resize=750%2C497&amp;ssl=1 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Beyond the brand supporting these children to achieve their academic dreams, we also appreciate the bond being shared with their mum, recognizing mother’s role towards nation building, hence the topic for the essay “Why my Mum is a Super Mum”.
