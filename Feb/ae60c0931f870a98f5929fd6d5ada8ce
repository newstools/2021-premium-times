Holloway had shown signs he is in the mood for great things when during the heats he registered a fast time of 7.32 thus smashing the meeting record and equalling his own world-leading mark and North American record. He was even quicker in the final, though, and won the race by 0.22 with world indoor champion Andrew Pozzi finishing second in 7.51. The victories in Madrid were Holloway’s ninth and 10th wins of 2021, and he now extends his winning streak in indoor sprint hurdles races to 54 races.

The track star now holds four of the six fastest 60-meter hurdle performances in history — all at 7.35 or faster, according to World Athletics. The new record by Holloway is subject to ratification by World Athletics. Donate TEXT AD: To advertise here .
