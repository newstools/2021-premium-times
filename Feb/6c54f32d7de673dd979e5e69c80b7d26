The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) in Rivers State has uncovered a warehouse of compressed cannabis Sativa in Abuja Estate in Port Harcourt, Rivers.
The state’s Commander of the agency, Rachael Shelleng, who announced this in a statement on Sunday, said officers of the agency stormed the cannabis warehouse in the early hours of February 20. Ms Shelleng said the operation resulted in the recovery of 23 bags of compressed blocks of cannabis Sativa, weighing 621 kilogrammes and 0.029kg of cocaine.   “The seized cannabis Sativa has been estimated to have a street value of over N17 million. “Three male suspects were apprehended in connection to the seizures and taken into custody for further investigation,’’ she said. Ms Shelleng said that both Abuja Estate and Slaughter areas of Port Harcourt have been identified as very notorious spots for illicit drug peddling. She added that the agency would stop at nothing to ensure that the black spots and the entire state were sanitised of illicit drug menace. The agency’s chairperson, Buba Marwa, directed the operatives across the country and special commands to intensify the heat and take the battle to the criminals’ hideouts. “With the support of all stakeholders, this war is winnable. “The arrest a few days ago in Lagos of a suspect who has been on the run for over 10 years confirms that the maxim of the new NDLEA, that the criminals can only run, they can’t hide, is working because we will smoke them out of their hiding places,’’ Mr Marwa was quoted as saying.
