The Federal High Court, in Abuja, has ordered the arrest of Richard Laing, Managing Director, ExxonMobil Nigeria, according to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in a series of tweets on Wednesday. The EFCC stated in the tweets via its verified handle that the judge, Okon Abang, issued the bench warrant against Mr Laing following an application by the commission’s lawyer. The commission said it resorted to asking for the arrest warrant since Mr Laing allegedly ignored three successive invitations to answer to procurement fraud allegations.
